  <p align="justify"><strong>NYC Animal Project</strong> is a struggling `no kill` cat shelter in the heart of new york that relies entirely on fosters and help from small donations. I can say personally having volunteered for them, even a few cents donation would make a difference for the very small organization. I fostered many kittens from them, and Pistachio was the runt that went un-adopted. She was shy, but very outgoing when she got settled. I highly recommend to foster and adopt if you can.</p>
